### The structure of the repository

This repository contains the following code:

* `./src/ckeditor` contains the CKEditor component,
* `./src/app` a demo application using the component.

**Note:** The [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-angular) contains a [packaged component](#packaging-the-component) only.

### Testing the component (demo)

To open a demo application using the component, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

To test it in the production, use:

```bash
npm run start -- --prod
```

```bash
npm run test

### Releasing

#### Generating the changelog

```bash
npm run changelog
```

#### Packaging the component

This project uses the [ng-packagr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-packagr) to create a package meeting the Angular Package Format specification. Calling

```bash
npm run build-package
```

#### Testing a package before releasing

Having generated a package, create a symlink to the `ckeditor5-angular/dist` package directory to test it in another (3rdâ€“party) Angular project:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/ckeditor5-angular/dist node_modules/\@ckeditor/ckeditor5-angular
```

You may also need the following config in `angular.json` to include the symlinked component package without errors:

```json
{
	"project-name": {
		"architect": {
			"build": {
				"options": {
					"preserveSymlinks": true
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

creates a package in the `./dist` directory, which can be then published in npm.

#### Publishing the package

To publish the new package in the npm registry, run:

```bash
npm run release
```
